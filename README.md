# MemoryPalace-Project

##Introduction
Memory Palace is a program for Java that constructs a memory palace and returns a tour of it after prompting a user for input.

### Getting Started
Start by downloading the package to your file system. First, make sure you have Java downloaded on your computer as well as the DrJava
IDE which can be found here: 

http://www.drjava.org/

Open the MemoryPalace program, compile and run it. 

####Running the Program 
Once running the program, you will be prompted to enter a string of a place, a string of an item, and a string of an object. 
This process will continue until the user inputs the string "stop." Then, the program will return a String representation of a tour
through the memory palace.
